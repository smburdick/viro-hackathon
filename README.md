# viro-hackathon
- Install the stuff in the [quick start guide](http://docs.viromedia.com/docs/quick-start), but don't generate the project
- make sure you have the right API key
- navigate to the project root, `sudo npm install`
- `npm start`
## Binary Search Tree (maps numbers to colors) animation
- Need to hardcode the tree for now
- Each node should be colored and numbered
- There will also be a sign behind the tree showing the number we're looking for, and when the red sphere lands on it, we will show the color it found
- Possibly show deletion?
